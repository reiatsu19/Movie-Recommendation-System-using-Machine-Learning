This Jupyter Notebook implements a movie recommendation system using Python and data manipulation libraries. It reads a movie dataset, cleans and transforms the data, extracts features using CountVectorizer, and calculates cosine similarity between movies. The recommendation function suggests similar movies based on an input movie, demonstrated with 'Avatar.' The code also serializes processed data and similarity matrices into pickle files for later use. To run this code, ensure the required libraries are installed, provide the correct dataset path, and execute each code cell sequentially which can be seen in this repository.
This Streamlit app functions as a movie recommendation system and user authentication platform. Users can navigate through three main sections: "Home Page," "Login Page," and "Sign Up Page." For the "Login Page," users can input their credentials to access personalized recommendations. Upon successful login, the recommender system presents movie suggestions based on the selected language (English, Malay, Chinese, or Tamil). The "Sign Up Page" allows users to create new accounts. The app integrates SQLite for user data storage and employs translation capabilities using the Googletrans library. To use the app, select options from the sidebar, enter credentials as needed, and explore personalized movie recommendations.
